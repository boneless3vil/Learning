# -----
# Not sure whether to use a for loop or a while loop? Remember that a while
# loop is great for performing an action over and over until a condition has
# changed. A for loop works well when you want to iterate over a sequence of
# elements.

# convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, iterate a range from 0-100, in blocks of 10
def to_Celsius(n):
    return (n - 32) * 5 / 9
for n in range(0, 226, 10):
    print(n, to_Celsius(n))


# To quickly recap the range() function when passing one, two, or three
# parameters:
#   One parameter will create a sequence, one-by-one, from zero to one less
#   than the parameter.
#
#   Two parameters will create a sequence, one-by-one, from the first parameter
#   to one less than the second parameter.
#
#   Three parameters will create a sequence starting with the first parameter
#   and stopping before the second parameter, but this time increasing each
#   step by the third parameter.

# nested for loops can greatly slow down a computer

for x in [25]:  # using [] by themselves creates list in this case. Very cool!
    print(x)

# common in error in a for loop
def greeting_friends(friends):
    for friend in friends:
        print("hi " + friend)

greeting_friends(['Taylor', 'Louisa', 'Jamaal', 'Eli'])
greeting_friends('Schwarzenegger')  # prints each and every letter. This is
#   because it's not in a list.

# FOR loops:  iterates over a sequence of elements, executing the body of the
# loop for each element in the sequence.

# WHILE loops: used when thereâ€™s an unknown number of operations to be
# performed, and a condition needs to be checked at each iteration.

# RANGE() function: generates a sequence of integer numbers.
#   It can take one, two, or three parameters:
#   range(start, end, interval)
